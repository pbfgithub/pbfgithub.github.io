The news is not particularly surprising.\rNor is the news particularly surprising.\r副词倒装句\n 表示地点、方向、次序的副词放在句首，主语是名词，谓语是系动词或不及物动词的时候，必须倒装。（主语是代词不倒装）  Up came the sun as we climbed to the mountain

Lulu.\r我在山上看到了Lulu.（不倒装）\r 补充： 我们熟悉的There be句型，其实就是一种特殊的地点副词倒装句。 There be句型，是英语里边极常用的一种句型，翻译为“有……”，其本质是强调某种东西“存在”，be这时是一个不及物动词，相当于exist。而动词have的本质是强调“拥有”。  There is only one happiness in this life，to love and to be loved.\r生命中只有一种情况叫幸福一—爱和被爱。（法国作家乔治桑名言）\rThere will be a large basketball match in our school next week.\r我们学校下周将有一场大型篮球比赛。\rThere have been bicycles stolen from the parking lot recently.\r最近停车场一直有自行车遭窃。\rMany people wonder if there might be life in other galaxies.\r很多人想知道其它星系是否可能有生命存在。\r 某些语法书说，have的主语是人，There be的主语是物。这种说法显然是错误的。 大家一定要记住：have是从属关系，there be仅仅强调某种东西“存在”，所以there be句型的主语一定是实体名词，而不能用抽象名词比如meeting，conversation等。\nThe house has many large rooms and there is a lovely garden.\r这栋房子里有许多房间，还有一个漂亮的花园。\r（本句里边rooms属于house的组成部分，而garden属于house外的东西，故前面用has，后面用there is）\r⑵强调句 普通强调 为了强调句中的某个成分，可以用下面的两种句型。 It is/was+名词/代词+who/whom/which引导的定语从句 It is/was+副词/介词短语/状语从句+that引导的名词从句\nMary is visiting us tomorrow.\r玛丽明天来看我们。\rIt is Mary who is visiting us tomorrow.\r明天来看我们的是玛丽。\rI bought this watch yesterday.\r我昨天买了这块手表。\rIt is this watch which I bought yesterday.\r我昨天买的就是这块手表。\rI quit my job because I didn't like the general manager.\r我辞职是因为我不喜欢总经理。\rIt was because I didn't like the general manager that l quit my job.\r我是因为不喜欢总经理才辞职的。\rThe tree was planted near a church fifty years ago，but it has gained an evil reputation only in recent years.\r该树是50年前栽在教堂附近的，但近几年得到了一个坏名声。\rThe tree was planted near a church fifty years ago，but it is only in recent years that it has gained an evil reputation.\r该树是50年前栽在教堂附近的，但只是近几年才得到了一个坏名声。\r注：强调句中的It is/was…who/whom/which/that在句子中不作任何成分，这是与It作形式主语的句型的区别。\n一般疑问句的强调：把is/was提到it前面 特殊疑问句的强调：疑问词+一般疑问句的强调句 Was it yesterday that he met president Obama？\r他是昨天遇到奥巴马总统的吗？\rWhat is it that makes a person so special？\r使一个人与众不同的究竟是什么呢？\r强调造句练习\n我是在公园里遇到玛丽的。\r我是为了我的健康的缘故放弃这份待遇优厚的工作的。\r是直到昨天你才完成这个工作的吗？\r究竟是哪个国家赢得了2010年世界杯呢？\r1.It was in the park that I ran into Mary.\r2.It was for the sake of my health that

B.\r那么问题来了，than后面的句子，动词is省略好还是不省略好呢很简单，than后面的句子中的动词和前面完全一致，那就可以省略，但是如果不一致，比如is变成了am，are，was，were等形式，那就不能省略。如果是一般动词，应以do，does，did代替）。\nMary is more beautiful than Jane.\rJohn is more handsome than I am.\r举例\nI like her.\rYou like her.\r如果要表达“我比你更喜欢她”，那么两句合并：I like her more than you like her. 此时，如果省略动词：I like her more than you. 那么，就出现歧义了，到底是“我比你更喜欢她”还是“我更喜欢她而不喜欢你”呢？因为“you”既可能是主格也可能是宾格。事实上，英文中所有的实义名词都是“主格”与“宾格”相同的。 所以，上面的句子应该写成：I like her more than you do.\n形容词一般比较\nBill Frith’s garden is larger than

hungry.\r因为我们饿了，食物就更加美味可口。\r准关系代词as,than,but引导的定语从句\n对比两个句子：\n1.我们了解到他通过了考试。\r2.正如我们了解到的那样，他通过了考试。\r我们会发现，上面两句话其实是同一个意思。英语中，也有和上面完全对应的说法：\n1.We learned that he passed the exam.\r2.As we learned，he passed the exam.\r as引导的定语从句。  传统语法认为：as通常用于引导井限定性定语从句，此时as代替整个主句，相当于which。\n这种说法显然比较牵强附会，造成很多英语学习者理解困难。其实这种句型同样属于比较状语从句，只不过as后面省略了复合关系代词what，只要知道了这点，马上就能理解了。\nAs（what/the thing that）I soon learnt，he was English himself！\r我很快了解到，他自己就是个英国人！\r主动式：As I soon learnt，he was English himself.\r被动式：As was soon learnt（by me），he was English himself.\r尤其要注意的是：本从句中的谓语动词，必须是及物动词！！！！！！ 而且主句必须是这个及物动词逻辑上的宾语。 比如上面这句话，learn是及物动词，后面的主句he was English himself.刚好就是learn的逻辑宾语！！！\n例句\nBut as they soon discovered，disguises can sometimes be too perfect.\r但他们很快就发觉，化装的效果有时过分完美了。\rAnyway，as Brian pointed out，it is the easiest thing in the world to give up smoking.\r不管怎么说，正如布赖恩指出的那样，戒烟是世界上最容易的事情。\rAs is known to us all，the whale is not fish but mammal.\r就像我们都知道的一样，鲸不是鱼类而是哺乳动物。\rShe was married again，as was

didn't pass the exam.\rAs is so often pointed out, knowledge is a two-edged weapon which can be used equally for good or evil.\rthan引导的定语从句 先看这句话：\nHe smoked more cigarettes than were normally available.\r他吸的香烟比他弄到的要多。\r如果按照传统语法把than看成关系代词，是很难理解的。 但是，只要我们按照下面的方式理解，就是一目了然了：\nHe smoked more cigarettes than（what）were normally available.\r这里，than后面省略了复合关系代词what，这样理解，立刻就能符合我们的正常思维方式。\n例句\nDon't drink more wine than is good for health.\r不要过量饮酒，适量饮酒有益于健康。\rI have more money than he needs.\r我的钱比他需要的多。\rHe is a good student than you are.\r他是个好学生，比你还好。\rThe manufacturers had to pay more money

supposed.\r看来人类早就致力于探索四季变迁了，比人们想象的要早20，000年。\rthan引导造句练习\n人们现在准备饭菜比以前容易多了。\r父母最好别给孩子太多的钱，够用就行了。\r所以今天想在某一领域成为专业人士要比以前花费更长的时间。\rPeople today can prepare their meal much easier than has ever been before.\rParents had better not give kids more money than is needed.\rTherefore, to be a professional in a certain field today takes much longer time than has ever been before.\rbut引导的定语从句 but作为准关系代词引导定语从句，是一种少见的用法，且只引导限定性定语从句。而且要特别注意，but本身具有否定意义，故引导的定语从句具有否定含义。\n另外，but修饰的先行词，通常会被否定词修饰。\n注：这个结构通常只能和there be句型搭配！\nThere is no man but errs.\r人必犯错。\rbut作主语，相当于\nThere is no man who doesn't err.\rThere is nothing but he knows.\r没有他不知道的事情。\rbut作宾语，相当于\nThere is nothing which he doesn't know.\rbut引导造句练习\n在场的人没有人不知道这个故事\r没有不爱自己孩子的母亲\rThere was no one present but knew the story

advise me.）（因为本句中有绝对性形容词no，所以用不定式作定语，而不用分词）\rHe was the first person to greet me when I arrived there.\r当我到那儿的时候，他是第一个来迎接我的人。（因为本句中有绝对性形容词first，所以用不定式作定语，而不用分词）\r关系代词作宾语引导的定语从句化简。（通常表示“有某事要做”）\nI will write a letter.\r我要写一封信。\rI have a letter to write.\r我有一封信要写。\r这两句话中文意思其实是一样的，英文意思也是一样的。\r此时，不定式to write作定语，修饰名词letter，但是一定要注意，这里的不定式动词write是及物动词！！！其修饰的名词letter就是不定式的逻辑宾语！！\n注意：\nHe never has anything

with.他人不错，可以与他共事。\r关系副词引导的定语从句化简：（此时不定式短语必须是不及物动词，或者及物动词+宾语）\nThe time to go is July.（不及物动词go）应该在7月份去。\r（相当于The time when we should go is July.）\rIt is time to draw a

当不定式的逻辑主语和句子的主语不一致的时候，通常用下面的结构：for+名词+不定式\nHe expects for his sister to meet you.\r他期望他妹妹认识你。（相当于He expects that his sister can meet you.）\rThere is no need for you to go.\r你没有必要去。\rDentists always

不定式的4态构成非常简单，就是to+4态，而不定式的被动语态，就是to+4态的被动语态（但进行态和完成进行态很少用于被动语态）。 以动词do为例\n   4态 主动语态 被动语态     一般态 to do to be done   完成态 to have done to have been done   进行态 to be doing 一般不用   完成进行态 to have been doing 一般不用    He wanted some photographs to be taken when he visited Taiwan.\r他在台湾参观的时候想找人拍几张照片。（一般态，被动语态）\r不定式的完成态，表示不定式的动作发生在谓语动作之前。\nFishermen and sailors sometimes claim to have seen monsters in

相当于名词从句里边的that从句的化简。任何一个that从句，都可以用动名词短语代替。动名词具有名词的性质。所以，名词能作什么，动名词就能过作什么。\nMany people pretend that they understand modern art.\r这句话中，宾语从句可以改成动名词短语\rMany people pretend understanding modern

day当然是句中的“我”发出的动作）本句如果改成主语从句，那就是：That I work 12 hours a day exhausts me completely.但是这里用主语从句，远远不如用动名词短语作主语简洁明了。\nPlaying football is my favorite sport.\r踢足球是我最喜欢的运动。\r改成主语从句为：That I play football is

my/me making a suggestion.\rMy teacher's refusing to accept my suggestion upset me.\r动名词短语的时态 动名词短语和分词短语完全一样：没有“时”的变化，只有“态”的变化，而且同样只有一般态和完成态。同样，和分词短语一样，动名词的两种态，均有主动语态和被动语态两种语态。当动名词的动作和主句主语同时发生，用一般态。如果是表示被动的含义，要用被动语态\n（注意：动名词短语如果是being，任何时候都不能省略）\nNo one can avoid being influenced by

ago.\r我很感激两年前得到一次出国留学的机会。（完成态，被动语态）\r下面两个短语为固定搭配，虽然是主动的形式，却是被动的含义！请死记硬背下来！ sth.need doing某事需要被做 sth.be worth doing 某事值得被做\nThe classroom is so dirty that it needs cleaning

不管简化前的句子是什么时态，简化为分词短语时都是一样的V-ing形式。也就是说：不管简化之前的句子是什么“时”，简化之后，通通不考虑其“时”，而只考虑其“态”。所以，现在可以告诉大家，分词短语没有“时”，而只有两种“态”：一般态和完成态。另外，定语从句简化为分词短语以后，是绝对不能用完成态的，所以绝对没有分词的完成态作定语的情况。\n 以动词do为例     2 态 主动语态 被动语态     一般态 doing being done   完成态 have done having been done     分词的完成态就是把助动词have变成分词having而已  Singing a song, he sat down.唱歌的时候，他就坐下了。\rHaving sung a song, he sat down.唱完歌以后，他坐下了。\r 上面第一句话是分词的一般态，表示“唱歌”这个动作（延续动词）和“坐下”这个动作同时发生。第二句话是分词的完成态，表示“唱歌”这个动作先发生.  构成分词短语的动词，不管延续还是非延续动词，简化成完成态以后都是having done。分词是没有进行态和完成进行态的。\nHaving watered the garden，he began to mow the

meat always goes bad in summer.肉在夏天经常会坏掉\r 如果你要表达“慢慢变”，可以用grow。因为grow的本意是“生长”，我们都是慢慢长大的  The weather grew cold in the night.晚上天气慢慢变冷\r 要表达“快速变”，应该用turn，因为turn本意是“转身”，当然是一下子转过去  His face turned
